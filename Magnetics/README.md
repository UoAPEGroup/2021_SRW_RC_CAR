## Description:
This "Magnetics" folder contains all of the magnetics simulations done for the primary and pickup coils to be used for the RC car design. The primary coils, which will go on track while the pickup coils would go onboard the RC car. 

## Specifications considered when designing the coils:
### Track Details:
- Length > 1000mm
- Width  = 300mm
- Tolerance Â± 50mm
- 
### Car details:
- Link: https://www.rchobbies.co.nz/tamiya-1-10-tt-02-subaru-impreza-monte-carlo-99-rc-car/
- Length: 16.6" (421mm)
- Width: 7.5" (190mm)
- Height: 3.8" (98mm)

### Other considerances:
- k, the coupling coefficient between the coils should not vary by more than 50%


## Dimensions for pick-up coil design:
### Secondary Coil:
#### Coil
- Width =  20mm
- Length = 18mm
- Height = 11mm

#### Ferrite
- Width = 109mm
- Length = 15mm
- Height = 8mm
