## Description:
This "Magnetics" folder contains all of the magnetics simulations done for the primary and pickup coils to be used for the RC car design. The primary coils, which will go on track while the pickup coils would go onboard the RC car. In the folder Final Design is the final ansys file containing the finished coil design and the Inventor files for the Track holder. 

## Specifications considered when designing the coils:
