# 2021_SRW_RC_CAR

Repo for work done during the summer workshop by the students on the RC car (2021-2022).

## Contributing

Create a branch for your feature / personal work and make changes in the relevant folders (i.e. Secondary/Hardware for members of the Pickup Hardware team).

When work is completed you make a "pull request" so others can review your work and then either changes will be requested or it will be "merged" into the main branch. This simplifies working in teams because everyone has their own "copy" (branch) and allows for greater flexibility.

For more information about branching see:

- Github Desktop: [the official tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches)
